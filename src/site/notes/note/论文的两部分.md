### 一、New materials and fabrication schemes（新材料与制造方案）

#### 原文：
"Gears, motors, and electromechanical actuators are fundamental to many of the robotic platforms in use today, but laboratories around the world have begun to explore new materials including artificial muscles (11), compliant materials for soft robots (12), and emerging advanced manufacturing and assembly strategies (13). As illustrated in Fig. 2, these promise a new generation of robots that are power-efficient, multifunctional, compliant, and autonomous in ways that are similar to biological organisms. However, most demonstrations using new materials and fabrication strategies have been 'one-offs' and must still overcome basic hurdles to achieve wide-scale adoption. These hurdles include improved portable energy storage and harvesting, new materials with tunable properties, and new fabrication strategies to embody these functional materials as new capabilities for future robots, including the robot building and repairing itself.

New materials that combine sensing and actuation challenge the physical limitations of traditional mechatronic systems and offer a range of opportunities for the design of new robots (14). Many of the design principles draw inspiration from nature. In vertebrates, one finds a wide range of material properties from soft tissue to bone—over seven orders of magnitude in modulus—that is mediated by a continuous gradient of compliance. As opposed to the more 'nuts-and-bolts' assembly approaches currently used to combine basic components into complete robots, a seamless integration of dissimilar material properties (e.g., rigid with soft, conductive with dielectric, etc.), spatially patterned with resolution several orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic dimension of the robot, could obviate the need for complex assembly and lead to distributed function.

Similar to functionally graded materials, multifunctional materials can increase the efficiency of robot design and simultaneously offer distributed networks of hierarchically structured sensors and actuators. Opportunities exist to leverage breakthroughs in folding-based metamaterials that have demonstrated tunable electromagnetic (15) or mechanical (16) properties beyond what is possible with the base material itself. Similarly, multiphase composites may be used for simultaneous fluidic actuation or sensing (17, 18). Textiles are a promising material for soft and wearable robotics, generating significant interest in embedding electrical functionality into fabrics. Finally, bidirectional transducers can enable sensors and actuators to behave as materials for energy harvesting or storage. While developing new materials for the future of robotics, it will be important to consider the biodegradability issues or as part of the circular economy paradigm to ensure their eco-sustainability. This is particularly relevant given the ubiquitous nature of robotic platforms in future (19, 20).

Fabrication and assembly is typically a serial process that is slow and difficult to scale to very large or very small scales. The 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three pioneers in the field of mechanochemistry who created the first synthetic molecular machines. A major remaining challenge that has thus far not been realized, despite Feynman’s prophecy (21), is to develop materials by integrating these molecular machines, or other force-generating molecules or biological motor proteins, into hierarchical materials. Substantial opportunity exists in the convergence of additive and subtractive methods, with emerging technologies involving two-dimensional (2 D) to 3 D transformations to generate new architectures that can simplify the need for specialized hardware and enhance the robot’s function. For example, 3 D printing (or similar techniques such as multiphoton lithography or selective laser sintering) can create features and structures over nine orders of magnitude in size. However, there is no single technique or machine that can cover this range—the best additive manufacturing strategy covers roughly three or four orders of magnitude in scale range—and none offers more than a handful of materials choices. Alternative methods should be explored that combine techniques from micro-/nanoscale fabrication (e.g., surface and bulk micromachining; physical and chemical deposition; and microscale molding, stamping, and functionalization used in soft lithography), mesoscale methods such as layering and lamination common in multilayer printed circuit boards, and the myriad macroscale multi-axis subtractive methods. Another challenge that requires much more investigation is the development of multiscalar materials able to adapt and heal over time, thus providing 4 D robots that achieve the complexity found in natural systems (22)."

"齿轮、电机和机电执行器是当今许多机器人平台的基础，但全球实验室已开始探索新材料，包括人工肌肉（11）、软体机器人的柔性材料（12）以及新兴的先进制造和组装策略（13）。如图 2 所示，这些技术有望创造出新一代高效能、多功能、柔韧且自主的机器人，其特性类似于生物有机体。然而，大多数基于新材料的演示仍处于‘一次性’阶段，需克服基础障碍才能广泛应用。这些障碍包括改进便携式能量存储与采集、可调特性的新材料，以及将这些功能材料转化为未来机器人新能力的制造策略（包括机器人自我构建与修复）。

结合传感与驱动的材料突破了传统机电系统的物理限制，为新型机器人设计提供了机遇（14）。许多设计原则源于自然启示：脊椎动物体内从软组织到骨骼的模量跨越七个数量级，通过连续梯度柔顺性实现。与当前‘螺栓螺母’组装法不同，若能在空间上以比机器人特征尺寸小数个量级的分辨率整合异质材料（如刚柔结合、导电与介电结合等），将消除复杂组装需求，实现分布式功能。

类似于功能梯度材料，多功能材料可提升机器人设计效率，同时提供分层结构的分布式传感-驱动网络。折叠超材料领域取得突破，展现出超越基材的可调电磁（15）或机械特性（16）；多相复合材料可用于流体驱动或传感（17,18）。纺织品在柔性可穿戴机器人中前景广阔，尤其是嵌入电功能的织物。双向换能器可使传感器/执行器兼具能量收集或存储功能。开发新材料时，需考虑生物降解性及循环经济，确保生态可持续性（19,20）。

传统串行制造工艺速度慢、难以跨尺度扩展。2016 年诺贝尔化学奖授予了机械化学领域三位先驱，他们创造了首个合成分子机器。但如何将分子机器/生物马达蛋白整合为分层材料仍是未实现的挑战（21）。增材与减材技术的融合（如 2 D 到 3 D 转换）可简化专用硬件需求，例如 3 D 打印能在九个量级尺度上构建特征，但单种技术仅覆盖 3-4 个量级且材料选择有限。需探索微/纳加工（表面/体微加工、物理/化学沉积、软光刻）、介观层压（如多层 PCB）与宏观多轴减材技术的结合。另一挑战是开发随时间自适应和自愈的多尺度材料，实现自然系统复杂性的 4 D 机器人（22）。"

### 二、Bioinspired and biohybrid robots（生物启发与生物混合机器人）

#### 原文：
"As human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature, nature becomes a more useful teacher (23). By bioinspired robotics, we mean the use of fundamental biological principles that are translated into engineering design rules for creating a robot that performs like a natural system. If the biological understanding results in the direct use of biological material to design synthetic machines, then we refer to this as a biohybrid robot. Specific grand challenge lists for biorobotics have remained largely unchanged for the past 30 years—a battery to match metabolic conversion, muscle-like actuators, self-healing material that manufactures itself, autonomy in any environment, human-like perception, and, ultimately, computation and reasoning. For recent progress on these and other specific challenges, we refer readers to a few of the many outstanding perspectives and reviews (4, 24–31). Here, we identify major goals that, if met, would accelerate the design and implementation of bioinspired and biohybrid robots at an unprecedented pace.

Major challenges remain for nearly all component technologies (Fig. 3) that could enable bioinspired behavior. Materials that couple sensing, actuation, computation, and communication are critical and must be shared as developed (32). Novel designs of heterogeneous, anisotropic, hierarchical, multifunctional materials have used differing designs of structural elements to increase material strength, stiffness, and flexibility; fracture toughness; wear resistance; and energy absorption (33). These advances promise to provide robots with features such as body support, weight reduction, impact protection, morphological computation, and mobility. Techniques newly available to fabricate architectures at the micro-, meso-, and macroscales include recombinant technologies, biomineralization, layer-by-layer deposition, origami and kirigami, self-assembly, bio-templating, magnetic manipulation, freeze-casting, vacuum-casting, extrusion and roll compaction, laser engraving, additive manufacturing, actuator-embedded molding, and soft lithography (33).

For biohybrid and bioinspired robots, actuation and energy remain major bottlenecks compared with performance seen in animals (34). Electromagnetic motors are adequate actuators for large robots but inefficient at small scales or in soft systems. New artificial muscles could revolutionize bioinspired robots; current versions that have muscle-like function and operate by shrinkage or expansion of material—such as shape-memory materials and electro-active polymers—lack robustness, efficiency, and energy and power density. No battery can yet match metabolic energy generation in organisms, so highly miniaturized, biohybrid robots actuated by biological muscle become advantageous (28). Biohybrid robots can exploit the unique features of living cells that include self-healing (35), embedded sensors, dynamic response to changing environmental conditions, and use of inexpensive and eco-friendly fuel (28).

A major challenge remains as to how these components are effectively integrated and embodied to perform system-level behaviors (Fig. 3). The field of bioinspired robotics must address different challenges, mainly due to the synthesis/fabrication of efficient and scalable artificial components. However, biology has made progress toward providing principles, especially for mobility and manipulation. New discoveries in hydro-, aero-, and terradynamics have led to an impressive 'robo-zoo' of bioinspired robots (24, 25) benefiting from the nonlinear, unsteady, self-stabilizing, energy storage, and return principles quantified in animals. Further development is required to understand transitions and multimodal performance (36) within the same platform. Significant progress has been made in bioinspired, quasi-static, pick-and-place manipulation, and grasping, but no system has integrated components sufficiently to match the flexibility and dexterity of human hands (37).

As bioinspired robots venture beyond the laboratory, models of real-world, unstructured environments will be required, but none can yet adequately represent our complex, dynamic world. Although first-principle models exist for hydro- and aerodynamic systems (i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations), a similar framework for terradynamics (38) is required to understand how bioinspired robots effectively interact with the ground. Because of their staggering complexity, one of the greatest challenges to extracting fundamental principles from biological systems involves model abstraction and dimensional reduction (39). Internal models can allow us to test hypotheses and simplify control, especially when placed into a dynamical systems theory framework (40). These models become even more important as we require simple representations for use in reinforcement, supervised, and deep learning for adaptability, decision-making, and even creativity."

"随着人类技术越来越多地承载自然特征，自然本身成为更具价值的导师（23）。生物启发机器人学指将生物学原理转化为工程设计规则，创造性能类似自然系统的机器人；若直接使用生物材料设计合成机器，则称为生物混合机器人。过去 30 年，生物机器人学的重大挑战清单基本未变——包括匹配代谢转换的电池、类肌肉执行器、自制造的自愈材料、全环境自主性、类人感知及最终的计算与推理能力。相关进展可参考权威综述（4,24-31）。我们提出加速设计落地的核心目标。

几乎所有组件技术仍存挑战（图 3）。需开发集传感、驱动、计算与通信于一体的材料（32）。异质/各向异性/分层多功能材料通过结构设计提升强度、刚度、柔性、断裂韧性、耐磨性与能量吸收（33），赋予机器人身体支撑、减重、抗冲击、形态计算与移动能力。微/介观/宏观制造新技术包括：重组技术、生物矿化、逐层沉积、折纸/剪纸、自组装、生物模板、磁操控、冷冻铸造、真空铸造、挤压辊压、激光雕刻、增材制造、执行器嵌入式成型与软光刻（33）。

相比动物，驱动与能源仍是主要瓶颈（34）。电磁电机适用于大型机器人，但在小微/软体系统中效率低下。新型人工肌肉（如形状记忆材料/电活性聚合物）存在鲁棒性、效率与功率密度不足问题。尚无电池匹配生物代谢产能，因此生物肌肉驱动的微型生物混合机器人具备优势（28）。这类机器人可利用活体细胞的独特特性：自愈（35）、嵌入式传感器、环境响应动态性、低成本环保燃料（28）。

如何集成组件实现系统级行为仍是挑战（图 3）。难点在于高效可扩展人工组件的合成制造。生物学已提供移动与操作原理——流体/空气/地面动力学新发现催生了仿生‘机器人动物园’（24,25），其受益于动物运动的非线性、非稳态、自稳定、储能与能量回馈机制。需研究同一平台的模式转换与多模态性能（36）。静态抓取已有进展，但尚无系统能媲美人手的灵活性与灵巧度（37）。

当仿生机器人走向实际应用时，需建立真实非结构化环境模型，但现有模型无法充分表征动态复杂世界。尽管流体/空气动力学有纳维-斯托克斯方程，地面交互的‘地面动力学’框架（38）尚未完善。生物系统复杂性带来模型抽象与维度缩减挑战（39）。基于动力学系统理论的内部模型可验证假设并简化控制（40），这些模型对强化学习、监督学习与深度学习在适应性、决策乃至创造力中的应用至关重要。"
